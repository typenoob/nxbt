## Motivation

Since [Brikwerk](https://github.com/Brikwerk) is no longer active in github nowadays. I intend to maintain this project on this branch to ensure its continued development.

## Plans

My plan is to commence by maintaining a fork of the project. Upon reaching a sufficient scale and independence, I will establish it as a standalone repository.

- [ ] Clean the code
- [ ] Use pyproject.toml and uv to manage the package and requirements
- [ ] Fix webapp unexpected behaviors
- [ ] Use [bumble](https://github.com/google/bumble) to rewrite the repo
- [ ] Add windows support to generic USB drivers through [zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/), such as [WinUSB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/introduction-to-winusb-for-developers)
